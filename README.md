# NeuroBox

One of most common hair-pulling issue that psychologists or neuroscientists are facing when setuping an experiment is **sending triggers (*i.e.*, event markers) to other recording devices** such as BIOPAC® or EEG systems. The whole ecosystem of hardware for cognitive science is corrupted by proprietary systems, with brands such as Chronos® or Cedrus filling the gaps and taking advantage of researchers and their often publicly-funded research. As a results, scientists are left with **expensive**, **complicated**, and **bad** options to precisely time their experiment.

**NeuroBox is the remedy.**

NeuroBox aims to help you send triggers (event markers) from your experiment to other systems. It relies on the most accurate technique, a **photosensor**, which will react to the **stimulus' physical display *on the screen*** and send this information to your recording device.

**This is a new and work in progress project. If you are interested by helping or using it, do not hesitate do let us know by opening an issue.**
